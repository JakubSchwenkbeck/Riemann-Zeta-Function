# Riemann Hypothesis Zeta Function Visualizer

Welcome to the **Riemann Hypothesis Zeta Function Visualizer** project! This project utilizes **Python** along with NumPy, Plotly, and PyQt5 to create an interactive graphical user interface (GUI) that visualizes various functions related to the **Riemann Hypothesis**.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to provide a visual exploration of functions associated with the Riemann Hypothesis. The application features multiple plots, including prime number counts, complex zeta functions, and Dirichlet's L-function, to help users gain insights into these mathematical concepts.

## Features

- **Prime Number Count and Approximation Functions:** Visualizes the distribution of prime numbers and various approximation functions.
- **Complex Zeta Function Visualization:** Displays the complex zeta function in a 3D grid, offering an interactive view of its behavior.
- **Dirichlet's L-Function:** Provides plots for Dirichlet's L-function with different moduli, including modulus 4.

## Example Plots

Here are some examples of what you can visualize with the application:
