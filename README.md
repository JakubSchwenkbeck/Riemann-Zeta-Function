# **Riemann Hypothesis Zeta Function Visualizer**

Using **Python** together with NumPy, Plotly and PyQt5 this project creates a GUI which displays different plots of functions related to the **Riemann Hypothesis**


**Example Plots :**  
 - Count of Prime Numbers and Approximation Functions:



 - Standard real Zeta function with set magnitude t:




 - Complex Zeta function displayed in a 2D grid, showing trivial zeros and critical line with non-trivial zeros
